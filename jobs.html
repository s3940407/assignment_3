      <div class="para">
        <p>By having a professional app and web developer with past experiences in this field would benefit our team a lot as they would have the required skills needed in order to bring Matcher come to life and be available to the public. It would be preferred if the individual we employ would be a good team player and is able to take everyone’s opinion and consider them as advice or suggestions. </p>

      <h2>Project Manager</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>A project manager would be effective and efficient for building Matcher as they would oversee and assist with a people’s performance and the mini projects to help build Matcher. Further they would follow up and ensure that target goals for the creation of Matcher are correct and on the right track. This would be done through checking the blueprint of how Matcher will be made and its main purpose, making sure expectations are met and everyone participating on its build is working effectively and efficiently.</p>

      <h2>Cyber Security Analyst</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>Matcher requires its users to input a large amount of personal information and therefore will require a cyber security analyst to build a strong security infrastructure for the apps networks. Here the cyber security analyst should have a thorough understanding of the range of cyber threats a system can face and the various methods to not only manage and resolve these threats but also to have systems in place within the security infrastructure to limit the chances of cyber attacks. Since Matcher will be constantly updated for example with user information relating to profiles being updated or created cyber security analysts will need to ensure that a flexible security network is established that can be updated and debugged. </p>

      <h2>Marketer</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>If the team is able to develop the app effectively and allow it to complete its tasks that it was made to do without interruptions, it would still need resources towards the promotion of the product, so small businesses and social media managers can actually become aware of its existence as well as the benefits that using this app might hold. A marketer being hired for the team would help build an image for the app. A marketer would also take steps to build up campaigns in which objectives can be set and efforts be made to expanding the reach of this app.</p>
