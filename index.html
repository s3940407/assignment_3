          <p>My name is Theo Constas (s3898834), I am 19 years old, and I am from Melbourne, Australia, and am a part of “Turbulent and Others”, the group that I worked on this assignment with. I graduated at Overnewton Anglican Community College and began studying at RMIT in 2021 in a Bachelor of Business course majoring in Marketing. I am a 3rd generation immigrant as all my grandparents immigrated from Greece to start a new life in Australia. I used to find it difficult to find hobbies to stick to but over time I found that I enjoyed Tennis, which however I dropped right before entering senior level competition and instead began training in the gym for a source of fitness. My goals for the future are to become  wealthy to the point where I could pass down wealth to give future generations a somewhat more comfortable lifestyle. Goals for myself are to also explore the world, visiting countries for their unique cultures, languages and nature.

          <p>My name is Rahmat Randhawa and my student ID is s3952731. I was born in Christchurch, New Zealand and by ethnicity is Indian and I am a part of the Turbulent and others group. I don’t have any IT experience  apart from a digital technology course I took when I was 9 where the focus was more of filmmaking. Since I don’t have much of an IT background my interests within IT are constantly changing, currently I am very interested in cyber security more specifically firewalls as well as the influence of technology on industries and politics. My hobbies include traveling and reading but my newest hobby is DJ'ing which started after going to a couple of house music events this year. I bought my first deck last weekend and can't wait to start mixing music, especially old school Punjabi garage music with house music. </p>

          <p>My name is Shervonne (student id: s3940407) and I am a group member of “Turbulent and others''. I am an international first year Bachelor in IT student in RMIT from Malaysia. My hobbies are taking pictures of nature and discovering my creativity in aesthetics. My passion in IT started at a young age where technology had a constant development every year which has made me start on comparing the latest equipment with its previous models. Being a first-year student, my IT skills are limited as I am still learning different programming languages and developing new skills every day.

          <p>My name is Alyssa-Lara Wolfer and I am also part of the turbulent and others group, and my student number is s3968552. I come from a diverse family where my mum is from the Philippines and my dad is from Germany. However I can only speak English. I graduated highschool in 2021 at Keysborough College and hope to graduate from University with a Bachelor of Information Technology before the year 2026; where I can then hopefully complete further studies and do a graduate program. RMIT is the second Uni I have attended as I used to be enrolled at Monash and did my first semester there for a Bachelor of IT and Business.

        <h2>Joseph</h2>

      <div class="body">
        <div class="para">
          <p>I am Joseph Elie Moussi (student id: S3901807), Australian/Greek/Lebanese 20-year-old that used to live overseas between Greece and Lebanon for 10 years before moving back to Australia after Covid hit. I obtained my VCE for year 12 with an economic stream from the academy of Paris. In 2021 I studied a Bachelor of Software Engineering at RMIT for three semesters before enrolling in the Bachelor of IT. I can fluently read and write five language including English, French, Greek, Arabic and Turkish. I love politics and economics and every time I meet someone I tend to ask them what their background is and try to learn about their culture as much as I can. In terms of this course, in particular, I am looking forward to learning the different aspects of the IT world and moreover, I believe that this degree will expose me to more information. Having my uncle work in software really pushed me to dive deeper to learn about IT with its different aspects, from coding to designing to building networks etc… After doing a semester in the bachelor of Information technology, I realised that coding suits me and my goals better, which is leading me to go back and study, about code and its different languages and try to work on building new projects.
