        <p>Compared to the most recent assignment, I found that we were better in organisation for formatting the report, but also making use of to do lists and expectations for everybody to have tasks completed by a certain time. Communication was done well and calls made were made efficient by no wasting of time for when work had to be done. An improvement from the previous assignment that taught us a lesson was to be more aware of the due date and ensure that efforts could be made to allow for mistakes that did not threaten poor work or a late submission. Things that could definitely be improved upon in which were very evident in the previous assignment as well were some members communication with the group. Attempts being made to organise calls were alot less efficient with busy schedules or lack of responses, and people not attending some calls made it harder for delegation to take place in a way that allowed for work to be completed with alot of time to spare from the due date. Overall, I am happy with the way that the group has performed including myself, which is a great improvement from hte previous assignment.

        <p>Overall through stronger communication and more detailed delegations of tasks with set timelines helped our group be a lot more organised and productive compared to the last assignment. The most effective method for our group was creating a group to-do list which clearly outlined each group member's role within the project and when the tasks had to be completed by. Now even though tasks were not completed within the time frame outlined by some members, it was an organised approach which allowed the rest of the members to see the groups progression which meant we could be more organised in completing tasks instead of leaving everything to the last minute. Although our communication was stronger, it still needed to be improved since we had members within the group not joining the scheduled group calls and therefore make it difficult to divide tasks efficiently. Overall I was surprised how much more organised we were as a group based on our performance in the last assignment where tasks were left till last minute and the delegation of tasks were not even. One thing I learnt about the group was how motivated we can become after receiving a result that we were not satisfied with.

        <p>I am pretty satisfied with the progress and improvements our team has made compared to the previous group assignment. I would say that we were more organised in delegating the tasks with each other equally. It was also clearer in terms of communication with the team and I appreciate all the efforts made by everyone despite their packed schedules. Although not every member was able to join group meetings in class or via teams, I think the message and agenda got to be delivered with the members pretty well. However, I personally think that it would be best if all members were able to be present during the group meetings as it would be much easier to divide the tasks that everyone will be comfortable with. I hope that our presentation that will be due next week will have an even better organisation and response from everyone from the team. </p>

        <p>overall everyone in the group were able to work together efficiently. we were all able to improve from the last assignment and use our time effectively to get everything done. we made use of our time by assigning tasks and making sure everyone understood each section so that we could complete it properly. additionally, using imessage helped us communicate better with one another and understand each other’s progress. </p>

        <p>With this assignment, Theo, Shervonne and Rahmat had put in a lot of effort to keep the cooperation and team work going on. I personally wasn’t able to be as present as I used to be during the team meetings which would have helped spread tasks more evenly and everyone would have been comfortable with. I was motivated to work on this assignment hence the result that we got on the previous assignment. The tasks were spread pretty evenly and cooperation between the team members was amazing as well. Although I wasn’t able to join the meetings, other group members always kept me updated on what had been agreed on and what tasks were assigned to me. Negotiations between tasks was done in an efficient way without wasting time. The even spread of tasks made it easier to meet deadlines which was an improvement from the last assignment. Hopefully next time I would be more available to be present during meetings, which made it a bit harder to delegate tasks in an even way for the other team members. Overall I am satisfied with the outcome of the group, and with the amazing work that had been put in by the other team members for organising everything.

        <p>Overall our group was far more organised in comparison to the last assignment. Firstly, since to -do lists were something that helped us in delegating tasks in the last assignment, we decided to continue using them however we refined them. Instead of only listing tasks we assigned names to each of the tasks within the list of when we expected the task to be completed by and a check box which was to be marked when a task was completed by a member. This helped to not only ensure that tasks were reasonably evenly distributed between group members so that tasks were not left to last minute to complete therefore lowering the level of stress we felt, but it also allowed others within the group to see what stage everyone in the group was at and whether and where we were up to in the assignment. Since scheduling group calls on Microsoft teams was difficult due to everyone's busy schedules and even meant some members were not even able to join the call, we were still able to ensure all members were on the same page and understood their individual tasks as well as what the group had discussed/ decided during the meetings through checking the to do list. Although our communication was better in this assignment compared to the last, we still had issues. As mentioned above, some members were unable to join the scheduled group calls and therefore made it difficult to delegate tasks evenly and discuss steps that should be taken by the group moving forward since we were unable to receive all members feedback and therefore meant that some decisions were forced to be made by others due to time constraints. As a group we were unhappy with our performance in the last assignment and saw how we had the potential to do a lot better, therefore the group's motivation and organisation for assignment 3 was very surprising. Even though we got a later start to this project idea, we were able to establish clear timelines to ensure nothing was left to the last minute. We learnt how motivated our group becomes where we know we have potential to do better and how we all can actually work very well together if we have strong communication to establish clear guidelines. Overall it was a really enjoyable experience working together as a group and being able to utilise all team members' strength to create this assignment.
