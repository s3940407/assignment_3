        <p>With global unemployment increasing each year, our team has decided to come up with a small solution in hopes to help with decreasing the number of unemployment. Our team is also trying to build a connection between small businesses and social media managers with the application. </p>

        <p>We were motivated to provide a solution to the issues facing small businesses relating to finding adequately skilled employees. Matcher helps build connections between small business owners and available labour to reduce labour shortage issues. Matcher recognises the outdated trend of paper printed resumes being handed to employers and the time consuming nature of having to read through each resume to see whether or not the candidate fits into the role. Matcher instead uses an online platform to improve connectivity, by only providing recommendations based on whether the candidate successfully matches the qualifications listed out by an employer. By creating this app, we are able to show future employers that we have the ability to identify a need with an industry and provide a suitable and realistic solution.  We are also able to demonstrate the ability to provide a detailed well thought out plan which clearly lists out all steps required to achieve this plan, while also having the ability to build an app.

        <p>Platforms such as SEEK and Indeed currently exist that help connect available labour to occupations within the community however unlike Matcher do contain organised method recommendations and communication. Businesses can post their ads onto the website however do not have control of who responds. Businesses owners may receive many responses from labour, who may be available but don't necessarily have the skill set to satisfy the role. This means a lot of time can be wasted for business owners having to go through all these responses, which is an issue they won't have to face on a platform like Matcher where business owners and users are connected only based on qualifications, therefore ensuring that all recommendations make realistic candidates.
