          <p>Overall in the last assignment all members within the group had a strong understanding of the task and expectations, and most were able to provide flexibility in setting group calls as well as completing tasks last minute that were not allocated to them initially. However one of the biggest problems we faced was time management. Going forward our group's response to our time management issues has been to establish a more clear timeline of when tasks need to be completed. In the last assignment we were able to outline all the tasks that needed to be completed however failed to do them in a time efficient manner, moving forward our to-do lists will have a date attached to each task to avoid this issue. Another issue we faced was clear communication amongst all members which meant some allocated tasks were not completed. To avoid this issue, our group has decided to have progression calls to provide updates on what each group member has completed and ensure that all members are on the same page which helps in resolving communication conflicts as well as avoids issues surrounding time management. Regular progression calls will also help to ensure that team members that need extra assistance can ask for help while also ensuring a clear equal division of tasks which was also another issue faced by the group in the last assignment.
