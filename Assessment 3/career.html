        <p>My ideal first job is one in marketing, something that will allow me to gain experience in how the operations of marketing are properly run in a business for a certain amount of time. This can allow me to also see other aspects of how a business is run, allowing me to pursue my goal of being an entrepreneur, by using my skills and creativity to create something that I can sell myself into the market.

        <p>My career plan has changed slightly after looking at the burning glass data in assignment 2. I still have a interest within cyber security more specifically a risk analyst however when it comes to a specific role within a company, my outlook has become more targeted towards ensuring specific skills are included within the role based on employer demand and to ensure the skills I am practicing and developing within my job align with the industries current demands. For example I want to ensure that my profession includes either Java or SQL to ensure that I can continue to develop my skills in high demand software according to the burning glass data. Furthermore I want to ensure that the skills required within my profession can be more heavily focused on communication collaboration which a risk analyst job does require. Overall I am still interested in being a risk analyst, however after reading the burning glass data, my search has become more specific to ensure certain skills/softwares are being used.

        <p>My ideal job and career plan has not changed since Assignment 1 and Assignment 2. I am still mainly focused on the security side of the IT world and am more determined to gain the knowledge and skills required for a cybersecurity job throughout my university years in preparation for my postgraduate plans of seeking for a job related to the field.

        <p>A dream job of mine is to be a Software Engineer for a company I grew up around, an example is this Pixarâ€™s advertisement for a Software Engineer, Characters & Crowds. In this role they are looking for engineers that are willing to participate in self-individual projects or working with a range of technical groups to utilize their skills to work around their digital actors. What intrigues me about this job advertisement, was that Pixar was an animation production that I grew up watching movies from and always loved. So being able to have the opportunity to work at the company I grew up with would be more than amazing. Additionally, as I mentioned in my ideal job, I am fascinated in a career that will allow me to express my creativity and ideas, and with this occupation it will be able to do so in an team environment.

        <p>After undertaking this semester in the bachelor of Information technology, and after looking at the data from burning glass in the assignment 2, my career hopes and plans have changed drastically, having network engineering, as middle to lower positions, throughout different time periods, in regards to demand to the jobs from employers and how many job opportunities there are for people to apply to, I have decided to go back to my original plan of wanting to be one day a senior network engineer, and hopefully one day manage a team of developers, but to be able to do that I would haver to undertake a MBA masters course on top of the Software Engineering course at RMIT that would expand my knowledge as well as my expertise and will strengthen my skillset regarding code, software and managing teams and being more qualified for higher roles. </p>
