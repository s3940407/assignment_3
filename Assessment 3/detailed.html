        <p>In Australia there are currently “2.35 million” (ABA, 2021) small businesses that contribute to the economy, however not all small businesses are able to have access to resources, to achieve their own business objectives. Which sprouted our main aim for the app Matcher, which is to assist primarily small businesses in finding stronger connections with other business owners, so they can achieve their own goals in a more efficient and productive manner. To achieve this, our app must be easily accessible from a variety of devices like an iPhone, Samsung and usable for all users of all sorts of businesses. Further ensuring that the app is coinvent and handy, will help consumers feel more at ease when using the app and simple to navigate through. Whilst our main aim is to support smaller businesses, we simultaneously strive to increase the level of networking within the social media marketing industry. This will be done through the app's ability to communicate to other business owners regarding various topics. Additionally, since Matcher allows for both ends of the party to decide whether they have interest with the business, this allows them to see the sorts of businesses that want to work with them and what they don’t want to.

        <p>Matcher is an app that aims to build strong industry connections between available labour and business owners and does this through similar layouts to platforms such as linkedin, Instagram and tinder.

A brief overview of what our project will do:
Once a user has downloaded the Matcher app, they will be provided with 2 user mode options, either available labour or business owner. Based on the selection made by the user, each will receive a form asking them to enter a range of personal information. Once the user has entered their personal information and it has been verified, a profile will be created. From here the user will be provided a list of recommendations based on the information they have entered within their form. For example if a business owner has mentioned they are looking for labour with strong communication skills, they will be recommended labour that have also entered strong communication skills within their profile. A user will be given the option to swipe right (if interested) or left (not interested) on the recommendations. If a business owner has swiped left, they will be required to fill out a short description as to why this decision was made and is kept private and used by Matcher to provide more suitable recommendations. To further develop strong connection Matcher has a ranking system out of 5 stars next to a users profile where the higher the ranking the more closely a user aligns with another users demands and therefore will be positioned higher in a users recommendation list. Successful matches (both parties have swiped right) will open up a chat section between the 2 users where steps of employment can be discussed.

When making the decision of which project idea to use, The turbulent and others groups were able to narrow down the ideas by selecting a project based on industry demand. Within the workforce, especially after the global pandemic, not only did many people lose their jobs, but also struggled to find one and re-enter the workforce, which also left many businesses understaffed. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics “2.7 million people either lost their job or had their pad work hours fall” in 2020 (Professionals Australia 2022) The turbulent and others group recognised the need within the industry and therefore decided to choose to develop an app that focused on building stronger and more efficient connections between available labour and businesses using a more refined platform than those currently existing such as seek.com or Indeed.

Once we had selected the idea, each group member was provided a copy of the project idea to develop a greater understanding of what its aims are and how it works to achieve them. We then each took a turn to individually add notes onto the project idea in google docs on how we can further develop the idea to support the group's aim. Afterwards, in our next group discussion we all shared our ideas and based on everyone's inputs, we created a draft that reflected the group's additions to the idea. This draft was refined over the next couple weeks before submitting it for A2. Some of the changes we made from the original idea was to expand it so that the app not only focused on supporting small businesses, but businesses of all sizes by providing them the same platform. Another edit we made was to ensure that matches made between users were based on similarities shared between both parties and applications could only be submitted by the available labour that matched a businesses labour requirements. This was to ensure that the inboxes for both parties were not filled with unreasonable connections and instead help to create more efficiency and improve productivity in the matching process. Furthermore we included a rating system to ensure that the matches made were satisfying both users and if not, changes could be made to create more suitable matches. All these edits work to differentiate Matcher from other existing job searching platforms.

At this stage our group has a solid understanding on the layout and overall functions the app will require. Furthermore we have established some of the major key roles required for the execution of this project idea which have been outlined in the skills and jobs section within our assignment. We have determined that the 4 major players required for the successful execution of our application would be a cyber security analyst, marketer, web app developer and a project manager. Now our group is focusing on the execution of the app through creating a prototype which encompasses all of Matchers functionalities.

      <h2>Roles</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>Roles are necessary when developing a project, as they help to organise the group and structure a good plan in terms of how the app is created. Important roles include a leader, in which is the most knowledgable about the app and skills needed to create it, as well as the capabilities of their own team. This is important as a leader will be required to delegate to other people what is required of them, as well as perform on their in in work done and motivating their group to do well through rewards and encouragement. Leadership is one of the most important roles as they “have a commitment to capacity building and empowering others” (Roger Hughes). Another role that is important is a user interface designer. This role is important to understand convenience and understandibility to the potential users of the app. This person will be needed to design an interface that will not cause confusion or scare of any social media managers or small businesses, but instead create something that can be seen as inviting and easy to use. A role that will need to be required and contribute the most effort would be a cyber analyst. This person or group will provide the means to protecting the app, but moreso the databases and store the information about users, from outside attacks. This will be necessary as to protect the image of the app, but also from legalities that we might run into if it is shown that there was lack of duty of care on our side in the app development.

      <h2>Scope and Limits</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>This projects goal is to develop an app that can create a network between social media managers and small businesses in need of a social media manager. As this is the primary service being delivered, a reasonable scope for the project that can be created in order to indicate the success of the app is the first successful connection between a user and a small business. When this happens, it shows that our software and algorithms were successful in providing the service that we promise to deliver, and it we can know that it is ready for use to any users who need it.</p>

      <h2>Tools and Technologies</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>In order to create our app, we will be getting our inspirations from the app “Tinder” as our app’s interface will be similar with Tinder’s interface. Our team will be able to create the app fully by using a laptop with the ability to support JavaScript, Python, HTML5 and also AWS Mobile platform to build the app while also testing throughout the process. We will start by creating an authorization engine for our users to create a new account within the application. We would also need to emphasize on geolocation in order to find people that are near users. This is to help users to locate their possible candidate on the application that is within their preferred proximity. We would need to use two types of classes to accommodate both Android and IOS users. For Android users, we would either be using the android.location package or a MapView class and we would be using the CLLocationManager class and the Map Kit framework for IOS users. We will collect and create our database by using MongoDB and Redis as they are both easily scalable database environments. We would want our users to feel that their data and information will be secure while using our app so we will not keep the servers’ data but we will only store it on the users’ local devices instead which helps in keeping the data secure and encrypted. Based on our teams’ experience, we have limited knowledge on the programming languages required as we are only first year students but we are hoping to outsource the development of the app to people who may have better knowledge in creating an app alongside some past experiences of app development.

      <h2>Testing</h2>
      </div>
    <div class="body">
      <div class="para">
        <p>Testing of the app can be completed whenever a significant part of the app has been completed to a point in which its basic functions now work. An example of this can be when the completion of the account creation system is done, accounts can then be created and tested to see if they work properly. Moving forward with these accounts, once matching has been completed in the app, these accounts can be made to match with each other and attempt to communicate to see how well the app completes this process. Testing is important in the development of the app whenever significant progress is made to determine whether we can move forward, or changes must be made to already made progress.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <div class="para">
          <p>Potential risks that can occur in the creation of this project are potential mistakes that can cause mass leakages of data, creating a big distrust in the team creating the app, therefore causing support for it to drop and development to cease. Other risks can include the app offering a service in which customers prefer to just contact eachother through other traditional means that they are usually used to, such as LinkedIn or word of mouth. This means that the need for this app is non existent. The opposite that can occur is the risk of there being too much traffic that the group is not ready for, causing major crashes and people not being able to use the service, cause them to not see any use in continuing their account.</p>

      <div class="body">
        <div class="para">
          <p>The most major communication to take place between our group in terms of developing this project took place on teams calls, or in person in which we met in tutorials. During these times, we made efficient use of time to pick which tasks to complete based on skills we have, but to also seek out to do lists and due dates for certain tasks to be completed, as a means to help the progress of this project move forward with little to no uncertainty. In the event that members did ont participate in these meetings, they were made aware of the expectations brought up, as well as how they were delegated certain responsibilities.</p>
