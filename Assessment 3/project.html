        <p>Wireframe and prototype:</p>
        <p>For the prototype of our application, there has been different steps taken to be able to achieve the prototype.
</p>
        <p>First was the wireframe of the application. We decided to use Figma to be able to represent the wireframe. For the wireframe, firstly we brain stormed the ideas on how the app would work exactly, how it would be divided between different users, and how the functions would be spread out for different users.
</p>
        <p>We came up with the idea that the recruiters and applicants would have 2 different portals, hence we decided to get a landing page that would prompt the user to login or register, upon clicking on login the user would be asked to enter the username and password for their account, and would have access to the website’s features.
</p>
        <p>But if the user wants to register, then it would prompt them with 2 buttons, one for a labourer and one for a business owner.
</p>
        <p>Upon clicking a button the user would be asked to enter their details as well as a form of photo identification to be able to be recognised by other users, for the labourers, they would be asked to enter their details as well as resumes, reference contact details…
</p>
        <p>For the business owners, a brief explanation of themselves and personal details would be asked, as well as the job position that they offer, with terms and conditions and contact details of the company so the labourer would be able to contact them, if they get accepted after match.
At this stage, we started working on the wireframe, and got the login page and the second page done.
</p>
        <p>After discussion with the group we decided to design the app with a more of a minimalistic design, not overwhelming users with too many options, keeping every thing simple.
We decided to add a notification button at the bottom, as well as a chat button, a profile button and a main button.
</p>
        <p>If a match occurs between a labourer and a business owner a notification would be sent to both parties, and a new conversation would be created in the chats tab.
</p>
        <p>The users would have an option to upgrade to premium if they would want to see who is liking their profile even if a match doesn’t occur.
</p>
        <p>In addition, we decided to let the users swipe left if they are not interested and swipe right if they interested.
</p>
        <p>On the main page, the labourer would be able to see the recruiter as well as a brief overview of the job position offered, as text and would be able to interchange between the company’s page, the business owner’s profile page, and the brief overview of the job position to fill.
</p>
        <p>The business owner on the other hand would be able to change and see the labourer’s profile, his job experience and resume on the main page.
</p>
        <p>Moreover we decided to add a rating next to the labourer and the business owner’s profile, based on matching criteria, which would be placed next to user’s picture.
</p>
        <p>Finally we decided to do the wireframe for the landing page, as well as the home page, and the signing up page and the chatting page.
</p>
        <p>The wireframe of the pages have been designed by order of use, recreating the real experience of a user whether it is a labourer or a recruiter.
